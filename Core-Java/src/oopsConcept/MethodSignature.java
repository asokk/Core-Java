 Method Signature:
 
 * Method signature consists of name of the method and argument.
 
 * Return type is not part of the method signature.
  
 * Compiler will check for method signature when resolving method calls.
 
 * within the same class two methods with same signatures are not allowed.
 
 			eg: public void method (int i, float f)
 			
 				Method Signature : method(int,float)
